# Overview
This folder is part of the Gatsby convention. Gatsby looks in here to determine what pages
are in the website.

Each component in this folder will be routed to a page. For example `about.tsx` would 
be served for the path `http://localhost:8000/about`. 

In our case we only have `index.tsx`. It is special in that it will be served for the
default `/` route.
